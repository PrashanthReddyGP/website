            <p class="narrative">
                The bus wheezed to a stop, depositing Luffy, Usopp, and Nami near a weathered, fish-shaped building perched precariously over the churning sea. Waves crashed below, sending salty spray into the air. This was the Baratie Bistro, famed 'Echo Isle'. The air itself seemed thick with untold tales and the mouth-watering aroma of cooking.

            <p class="narrative">
                Luffy didn't wait, bursting through the doors with a yell. <span class="luffy-dialogue">"FOOD! STORIES! HELLO!"</span> The inside was bustling, a chaotic symphony of clanging pans, shouting chefs, and diners laughing. Presiding over it all from a high stool near the kitchen was a stern-looking man with a braided blonde moustache and a prosthetic leg – Zeff. But before anyone could react to Luffy's entrance, a commotion erupted from the kitchen.
            </p>
            <p class="narrative">
                A figure in a chef's uniform, blond hair obscuring one eye, a cigarette dangling from his lips, sent a rude customer flying with a precise, powerful kick. "Get out! Never waste food in front of me, you scum!" he yelled, his voice smooth but laced with fury. Dishes crashed. Nami groaned. Usopp hid behind Luffy.

            <p class="narrative">
                Nami managed to hold Luffy back for a moment. "Hold on, let's see what we're walking into." They watched from near the entrance. The Baratie was lively, filled with sailors, locals, and tourists. The smell of delicious food was almost overwhelming. They overheard snippets of conversation: "...heard Chef Sanji's seafood pasta makes you remember your first love...", "...Zeff runs a tight ship, but he's got a heart of gold...", "...Watch out for the 'Critique Pirates', they were sniffing around earlier..."

            <h2>Meeting the Fiery Chef</h2>
            <p class="narrative">
                Ignoring Nami's warnings (or Usopp's trembling), Luffy approached the blond chef, Sanji, who was lighting a new cigarette, looking thoroughly annoyed.
            </p>
             <p><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/50/FF0000/FFFFFF?text=L" alt="Luffy Icon" class="character-icon"><span class="luffy-dialogue">That was amazing! Your food sounds amazing too! I'm Luffy, I'm gonna be the King of Storytellers! Can you join my crew and cook story-food?</span></p>
            <p class="narrative">
                Sanji blinked, smoke curling around his face. He looked Luffy up and down. Before he could answer, Zeff's gruff voice cut through the air. "Sanji! Less kicking, more cooking! And who are these brats?"
            </p>
            <p class="narrative">Just then, a group of people in sharp suits entered, led by a man with an arrogant smirk. "Well, well. The infamous Baratie Bistro. We are the Critique Pirates. Prepare for a thorough... *deconstruction*." The air grew tense.</p>

             <p class="narrative">Nami steered them towards the imposing Head Chef Zeff. "Excuse me, Mr. Zeff? We heard this place inspires great stories..." Zeff eyed them skeptically. "Stories, eh? This is a restaurant, girlie. We serve food, not fairy tales." Suddenly, Sanji kicked a customer out. Zeff sighed. "That damn eggplant..." Luffy immediately ran towards Sanji. <span class="luffy-dialogue">"Awesome kick! Are you Sanji?"</span> The scene converges similarly to `scene3_approachSanji`.</p>

             <p class="narrative">Sanji stepped forward, fists clenched (ready for kicking). "You talkin' about food? Or the old man's heart? Either way, you're outta line." Zeff glared, his peg leg tapping ominously.</p>

        <!-- Scene 5 Climax -->
        <div class="scene hidden" id="scene5_luffyStory">
            <h2>The Power of Passion</h2>
            <p class="narrative">Luffy took a deep breath, grinned, and began. He didn't tell a polished epic, but a raw, energetic tale about freedom, friendship, and chasing dreams against all odds. He spoke of shared meals under starry skies, of overcoming impossible challenges with sheer willpower. As he spoke, fueled by the Baratie's unique 'Echo Isle' energy and the passion radiating from Sanji and Zeff, something happened.</p>
            <p class="narrative">Tiny, shimmering lights began to appear in the air around Luffy – <span class="story-spark">Story Sparks!</span> Faint at first, then brighter, more numerous. The diners gasped. Even the Critique Pirates faltered, momentarily stunned by the unexpected phenomenon.</p>
            <p class="narrative">Sanji stared, cigarette falling from his lips. He felt... something. A resonance. A reminder of his own hidden dream – the All Blue, a place where all the world's recipes could be found.</p>
            <p class="narrative">Luffy finished with a booming laugh. <span class="luffy-dialogue">"See?! Stories are AWESOME!"</span></p>
            <p class="narrative">Fullbody, unnerved by the Sparks, stammered, "Tricks! Cheap illusions!" But his voice lacked conviction. His crew looked uncertain.</p>
            <div class="action">
                 <button onclick="showScene('scene6_resolution')">Press the advantage! Drive the critics out!</button>

         <div class="scene hidden" id="scene5_teamUp">
            <h2>Words and Kicks</h2>
            <p class="narrative">Luffy's energy was infectious. Sanji, seeing Luffy's simple defense of passion, smirked. "He's right, you know. You wouldn't understand the soul of cooking if it kicked you in the face." He stepped forward, not physically attacking, but verbally dissecting the critics' cold logic with sharp, passionate arguments about flavor, memory, and the joy of eating.</p>
            <p class="narrative">Usopp, emboldened, launched into a wildly exaggerated tale of how *he* once debated a hundred critics into silence. Nami chimed in with cutting remarks about their lack of understanding of 'value'.</p>
            <p class="narrative">Luffy cheered them on. <span class="luffy-dialogue">"Yeah! Tell 'em! Shishishi!"</span> His sheer belief in his friends seemed to amplify their words. Small <span class="story-spark">Story Sparks</span> flickered around Sanji and Usopp as they spoke with genuine fervor.</p>
            <p class="narrative">The Critique Pirates, overwhelmed by the unexpected, passionate counter-attack and the strange lights, began to backpedal.</p>

            <h2>A New Ally (and a Meal!)</h2>
            <p class="narrative">Whether through Luffy's story or the team's verbal barrage, the Critique Pirates were routed. They fled the Baratie amidst the cheers of the diners and staff, muttering about reporting this 'anomaly'.</p>
            <p class="narrative">Zeff let out a gruff chuckle. "Hmph. Not bad, brats."</p>
            <p class="narrative">Sanji walked over to Luffy, lighting another cigarette. He looked thoughtful. "Oi, storyteller. Your tales... they got guts. And you defended the kitchen's heart." He paused. "...You need a cook for your 'Story Crew'?"</p>
            <p><img src="https://via.placeholder.com/50/FF0000/FFFFFF?text=L" alt="Luffy Icon" class="character-icon"><span class="luffy-dialogue">YEAH! REALLY?! Awesome! Let's eat first! I'm starving! MEAT!</span></p>
            <p class="narrative">Sanji sighed, a small smile playing on his lips. "Fine. But Nami-swan eats first." He winked at a flustered Nami.</p>
            <p class="narrative">As Sanji disappeared into the kitchen, promising a meal that would tell its own story, Luffy beamed. They had faced their first challenge, defended an Echo Isle, and gained a powerful new ally. The journey to the One Tale felt a little closer.</p>
